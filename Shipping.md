Effective Date: 2024-12-04

## Order Processing
Most orders placed with Elevated Sensors will ship the same or next business day, unless otherwise noted. All shipping estimates are in business days and are not guaranteed.

## Shipping Options (U.S. Domestic)
We offer three shipping options for most of the United States:

- **Economy (3-8 days)**: USPS Ground Advantage or UPS Ground Saver
- **Priority (2-5 days)**: USPS Priority Mail or UPS Ground
- **Expedited (3 days)**: UPS 2nd Day Air

## International Shipping
We offer affordable international shipping options to nearly every country through Asendia. Asendia handles last-mile delivery and customs clearance via your country’s postal service. For select countries, we also provide UPS Worldwide Expedited and DHL Express Worldwide services. Please reach out if you would like to see UPS/DHL services to your location.

## Import Duties, Taxes, and VAT
All international shipments are shipped “Delivery Duty Unpaid.” The recipient is responsible for paying any import duties, taxes, and VAT upon the shipment’s arrival and customs clearance. Warranty replacements will be marked as “Returned Goods”, but may still incur customs fees.

## Extended Service Areas
For locations classified as “Extended Service Areas” by the shipping carrier, shipping costs may be higher. If this applies to your order, we will contact you to discuss options and ensure that the additional cost is acceptable or suggest a more economical service.
